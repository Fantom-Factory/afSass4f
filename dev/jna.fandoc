JNA
***
The native libSass binaries and the JNAerated Java source file have both been lifted from [sass-java]`https://github.com/cathive/sass-java`.

To re-build, follow these commands (confirmed to work with Maven 3.3.1):

pre>
> git clone https://github.com/cathive/sass-java.git
> cd sass-java
> git checkout v4.0.0
> mvn clean generate-resources
<pre

'SassLibrary.java' may then be found in '/sass-java/target/generated-sources/jnaerator/'.

The pre-compiled native libsass binaries live in '/sass-java/src/main/resources/'. When copying to '/Sass4f/res/', ensure the directories are renamed appropriately to Fantom / OSGI standards.

Note that 'sass-java' seems to be abandoned after the v4.0.0 release. For newer libSass bindings, look at [jsass]`https://github.com/bit3/jsass`. I think the [releases]`https://github.com/bit3/jsass/releases` contain the binaries, so you may just need to compile the Java lib.
